----Executables----
./message - Tests the output of the message library
./threadpool - Tests the output of the threadpool library
./eventscheduler - Tests the output of the eventscheduler library

----Header Files----
threadpool.h - Contains the class and function declarations for a threadpool object
eventscheduler.h - Contains the class and function declarations for a eventscheduler object
message.h - Contains the class and function delcarations for a message object

----Drivers----
driver_message.cc - Drives the message library
driver_threadpool.cc - Drives the threadpool library
driver_eventscheduler.cc - Drives the eventscheduler library

----How To Run Program----
To Compile Files:
	make all
To Clear The Compilation:
	make clean
message:
	./message
threadpool:
	./threadpool
eventscheduler:
	./eventscheduler

----Testing----
The libraries were tested with the given drivers and the output
will be submitted.

----Unimplemented Specifications----
None

----Known Bugs----
1. Neither the eventsheduler nor the threadpool are completely thread-safe.    
   In the eventscheduler, I do not lock the queue when I am erasing an object
   and I believe this causes a seg fault when sort is called on the queue.
   In the threadpool, I can't locate where it is seg faulting. It doesn't seem to
   seg fault on linux but on my mac it does.
