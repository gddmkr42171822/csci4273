----Executables----

./echoClient - Simplest program that chats with a server using SSL and TCP
./echoServer - Simplest program that echos what is sent to it using SSL and TCP

----How To Run Program----

To Compile Files (be in the directory where the makefile is):
	make all

To Clear Compilation
	make clean

echoClient:
	./echoClient <port> <hostname>

echoServer:
	./echoServer <port>

**** NOTE ****
In order to run this program, you must have one instance of the
echoServer running before starting an instance of the echoClient.
All text is via the stdin of the echoClient terminal.

----Testing----
The server was tested with 'openssl s_client' which allowed me 
to view the server certificate, symmetric key, and crypto used
to transmit data.

----Unimplemented Specifications----
NONE

----Known Bugs----
NONE
