----Timings----
1. Avg time for 2 process-per-protocol hosts to send and receive 400 messages = 2.86 seconds

----Known Bugs----
1. Process-per-protocol works occastionally.  I cannot figure out what is wrong with it.
   I suspect either the socket send or receive or reading from 2 pipes and writing to 1.
